Assumptions:

The fare of both the airlines will keep on changing as we refresh the Price list button.
Web API is getting the data from SQL DB and angular client is displaying the airline data at UI (styling: CSS, bootstrap).

You may get service not accessible error because SQL server may not be in domain.
Hence i have attached the SQL query which is required to insert the data into sql DB.

Some data is also persisted in the memory, so that would be available even if service is down.

Due to time constraint, was not able to add the Unit Test Project.
If required, please let me know and i can share it by the end of this week.
